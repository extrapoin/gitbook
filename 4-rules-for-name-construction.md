# 4 Rules for Name Construction

INTRODUCTION

In this Chapter, principles regarding name construction are presented. It is recognized that in chemical discussions it may sometimes be convenient to depart from rigorous rules in order to provide a name more appropriate to the chemical intent or to avoid obscuring an important feature. However, such deviations should not be done without good reason, and names so derived are not recommended for general use in publications.

The application of the principles and rules described in this Chapter has been devised to lead to a preferred IUPAC name. Preferred IUPAC names are not necessarily the aim of a practicing chemist who wants to communicate with his colleagues in familiar, well understood terms, but it may be appropriate to those who cite chemical names in legislative documents, in international trade and commerce, or for preparing programs for index purposes, databases, and retrieval systems.

This Chapter includes the general rules and orders of seniority used in substitutive nomenclature and in other types of nomenclature when required.

P-41 SENIORITY ORDER FOR CLASSES

The order of seniority of classes is given in [Table 4.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t401). It ranks classes expressed by suffixes (classes 1 through 20) and classes based on the senior atom in compounds (classes 21 through 43).

Table 4.1 General compound classes listed in decreasing order of seniority

> 1 Radicals

> 2 Radical anions
>
> 3 Radical cations

> 4 Anions
>
> 5 Zwitterions
>
> 6 Cations

> > 7a ‘Suffix’ acids in the order carboxylic (not including carbonic or polycarbonic acids, which belong to sub-class ‘7b’), sulfonic, sulfinic, selenonic, seleninic, telluronic, tellurinic, each followed in turn by the corresponding peroxy, imidic, and hydrazonic acids. Chalcogen analogues follow each of the corresponding oxygen acids and, in each case, the chalcogen analogue with the greater number of the preferred chalcogen atom (O > S > Se > Te), considered first in −OOH groups, then in −OH groups as necessary. (See [P-42](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#42) for the complete list of seniority of acids, [P-43](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#43) for suffixes modified by functional replacement, and [Table 4.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t404) for an extensive list of the order of seniority of all these suffixes.)

See Classes 8, 9, 11 and 13, on lactones, lactams, anhydrides, imides.

P-42 SENIORITY ORDER FOR ACIDS

Acids of class 7 (see [Table 4.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t401)) in the order of classes of compounds are further classified into subclasses. These correspond to acids expressed by suffixes and acids used as functional parents (see [P-34](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P3.html#34)). The following subsections complete the brief description given in Class 7; the acids are described in decreasing seniority order.

> [P-42.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4201) Class 7a. Acids expressed by suffixes (excludes carbonic and polycarbonic acids)\
> [P-42.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4202) Class 7b. Carbon acids with no substitutable hydrogen atoms\
> [P-42.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4203) Class 7c. Noncarbon acids having substitutable hydrogen atoms on the central atom\
> [P-42.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4204) Class 7d. Noncarbon acids used to generate derivatives having substitutable hydrogen atoms\
> [P-42.5](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4205) Class 7e. Other monobasic ‘oxo’ acids used as functional parents.

polycarbonic acids

dicarbonic acid

carbonic acid

cyanic acid

P-42.3 CLASS 7c. NONCARBON ACIDS HAVING SUBSTITUTABLE HYDROGEN ATOMS ON THE CENTRAL ATOM

All these names are preselected names. In this class, criteria for seniority are, in descending order:

> (a) the central atom first in the list N > P > As > Sb > B;
>
> (b) maximum number of central atoms;
>
> (c) homopolyacids (isopolyacids) (see [ref. 12](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/refs.html#ref12));
>
> (d) having contiguous central atoms;
>
> (e) maximum number of acidic (–OH) groups;
>
> (f) highest oxidation number for the central atom

| For consistency in the names of polynuclear oxoacids, the numerical infix ‘di’ has been uniformly used in naming dinuclear ‘hypo’ acids, for example hypodiphosphorous acid, rather than hypophosphorous acid. |

P-43 SENIORITY ORDER FOR SUFFIXES

> [P-43.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4301) General methodology of functional replacement

P-43.0 INTRODUCTION

Suffixes are modified as indicated in [Table 4.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t403) for acids and in [Table 4.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t404) for all substituent suffixes. The order of seniority for suffixes is described in this Section. It is based on the seniority of classes 7 through 20 given in [Table 4.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t401) and includes suffixes modified by functional replacement.

P-43.1 GENERAL METHODOLOGY OF FUNCTIONAL REPLACEMENT

Suffixes are modified as indicated in [Table 4.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t403) for acids and in [Table 4.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t404) for acids and other classes. Prefixes and infixes are used as indicated in [Table 4.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t402). Prefixes are used to modify suffixes such as ‘ol’, ‘al’, for example ‘thiol’ and ‘thial’. Infixes are recommended to modify the suffixes ‘carboxylic acid’, ‘sulfonic acid’, and related suffixes, for example ‘carboperoxoic acid’ and ‘sulfonothioic acid’.

Table 4.2 Prefixes and infixes, in decreasing order of seniority, used to generate suffixes in preferred IUPAC names by functional replacement

When several oxygen atoms are replaceable, the following criteria are applied, in order, until a decision is reached:

> (a) maximum number of oxygen atoms, then S, Se, and Te atoms, =NH and =NNH2 groups;
>
> (b) maximum number of oxygen atoms, then S, Se, and Te atoms, in −OO− groups;
>
> (c) oxygen atoms, then S, Se, and Te atoms, in −(O)OH and −OH groups.

The order of seniority is described, in the case of carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and sulfinic acids, by indicating, after the name of the modified suffix the number and kind of atoms used in the replacement operation (see [Table 4.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t403)).

[Table 4.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#t403) gives the list, in decreasing order, of the seniority of suffixes and suffixes modified by functional replacement for carboxylic and sulfonic acids. Sulfinic acid suffixes are similar to sulfonic acids. Selenium and tellurium acid suffixes are formed by replacing ‘sulf’ by ‘selen’ or ‘tellur’.

P-44 SENIORITY ORDER FOR PARENT STRUCTURES

A parent structure is defined ([P-15.1.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P1.html#150101) and [P-15.1.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P1.html#150102)) as a parent hydride, for example methane, a functionalized parent hydride, for example, cyclohexanol, or a functional parent compound, for example, acetic acid. For choice of the preferred IUPAC name based on a senior parent structure, see [P-45](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#45).

> [P-44.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4403) Seniority of acyclic chains (the principal chain)\
> [P-44.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4404) Seniority criteria applicable to rings, ring systems, or acyclic chains

P-44.0 INTRODUCTION

The selection of a preferred parent structure is based on the seniority of classes (see [P-41](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#41)), which gives priority first to characteristic groups expressed as suffixes and then to parent hydrides when different classes are present. Section [P-44.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4401) covers the selection of a preferred parent structure when different classes are involved and the selection between rings and chains in the same class. When there is a choice among cyclic parent hydrides, the senior ring or ring system is chosen in accord with the seniority order of rings and ring systems (see [P-44.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4402)). When there is a choice among acyclic parent hydrides a principal chain must be chosen (see [P-44.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4403)). The three seniority orders, for classes, rings and ring systems, and the principal chain, are expressed in a general seniority order called ‘seniority order for parent structures’. Section [P-44.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4404) covers criteria for selection of a senior parent structure applicable to either rings, ring systems, or acyclic chains.

A thorough revision and extension of the seniority order of classes, of rings and ring systems, and for selecting the principal chain was needed in the context of preferred names. This revision incorporates a major change from earlier recommendations given in the 1979 edition ([ref. 1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/refs.html#ref1)) and the 1993 Guide ([ref. 2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/refs.html#ref2)).

| In acyclic parent structures the order of seniority between unsaturation and length of chain given in earlier recommendations is reversed. Thus, the first criterion to be considered in choosing a preferred parent acyclic chain is the length of the chain; unsaturation is now the second criterion. |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Note 1: Since the senior parent structure can occur in a compound in multiple ways, several plausible, unambiguous names can be generated. The criteria necessary to select a preferred IUPAC name are described in [P-45](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#45); thus, traditional criteria related to substituent groups are not incorporated in this Section.

Note 2: Criteria related to nonstandard bonding have been incorporated into the criteria applicable to either rings, ring systems, or acyclic chains ([P-44.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4404)); hierarchically, they come after the criteria related to unsaturation (double bonds) and before those related to indicated hydrogen atoms.

P-44.1 SENIORITY ORDER FOR PARENT STRUCTURES

When there is a choice, the senior parent structure is chosen by applying the following criteria, in order, until a decision is reached. These criteria must always be applied before those applicable to rings and ring systems (see [P-44.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4402)) and to chains (see [P-44.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4403)). Then criteria applicable to both chains and rings or ring systems given in [P-44.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4404) are considered.

P-44.1.1 The senior parent structure has the maximum number of substituents corresponding to the principal characteristic group (suffix) or senior parent hydride in accord with the seniority of classes ([P-41](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#41)) and the seniority of suffixes ([P-43](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#43)).

P-44.1.2 The senior parent structure, whether cyclic or acyclic, has the senior atom in accordance with the seniority of classes (see [P-41](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#41)) expressed by the following decreasing element order: N > P > As > Sb > Bi > Si > Ge > Sn > Pb > B > Al > Ga > In > Tl > O > S > Se > Te > C. This criterion is applied to select the senior atom in parents and to choose between rings and chains. It is not used to choose between rings or to select the principal chain modified by skeletal replacement (‘a’) nomenclature. If the most senior class is a ring system or a chain modified by skeletal replacement (‘a’) nomenclature, the senior parent is chosen among all rings (see [P-44.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4402)) or chains (see [P-44.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4403)) respectively.

P-44.1.2.1 When two or more atoms denoting different classes are present in a compound, and when the choice for parent compound is between these atoms, the parent compound is the one belonging to the class cited first in the seniority of classes given above. A single senior atom is sufficient to give seniority to the parent hydride.

| This rule is broader than Rule D-1.34 in the 1979 Recommendations ([ref. 1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/refs.html#ref1)) that referred to compounds where the heteroatoms were directly attached to each other. |

P-44.1.2.2 Systems composed of rings and chains (exclusive of linear phanes)

Two methods are recognized to name systems composed of rings and chains (exclusive of linear phanes).

(1) Within the same class, a ring or ring system has seniority over a chain. When a ring and a chain contain the same senior element, the ring is chosen as parent. Rings and chains are chosen regardless of their degree of hydrogenation. As a consequence, this approach prefers the choice of a ring over a chain in systems composed of cyclic and acyclic hydrocarbons.

(2) The context may favor the ring or the chain, so that, for example, substituents may be treated alike or an unsaturated acyclic structure may be recognized, or the one chosen has the greater number of skeletal atoms in the ring or in the principal chain of the acyclic structure.

In the examples that follow, when a choice is possible, names formed by both methods are given. For selection of a preferred IUPAC name, see [P-52.2.8](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P5.html#520208).

P-44.1.3 Seniority order only for rings and ring systems. Criteria that apply only when the choice for parent structure is between two or more rings or ring systems are given in [P-44.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4402).

P-44.1.4 Seniority among acyclic chains (the principal chain). Criteria that apply only when the choice for parent structure is between two or more acyclic chains are given in [P-44.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4403).

P-44.1.5 Criteria applicable to rings, ring systems, or acyclic chains, such as unsaturation, the presence of skeletal atoms with different bonding numbers, isotopically modified compounds, and stereochemical configurations are given in [P-44.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4404).

P-44.2 SENIORITY ORDER ONLY FOR RINGS AND RING SYSTEMS

> [P-44.2.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440201) Criteria general to all rings and ring systems (other than phanes, both cyclic and linear, for which see [P-44.2.2.2.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4402020202) and [P-44.2.2.2.6](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4402020206), respectively)\
> [P-44.2.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440202) Criteria specific to a particular kind of ring or ring system

P-44.2.1 If application of [P-44.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4401) does not effect a choice, general criteria for determining ring seniority given below are applied successively until there are no alternatives remaining. These criteria are listed first and then separately illustrated in [P-44.2.1.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44020102) through [P-44.2.1.8](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44020108), below.

The senior ring or ring system:

> (a) is a heterocycle;
>
> (b) has at least one nitrogen atom;
>
> (c) has at least one heteroatom (in the absence of nitrogen) that occurs earlier in the following sequence: F > Cl > Br > I > O > S > Se > Te > P > As > Sb > Bi > Si > Ge > Sn > Pb > B > Al > Ga > In > Tl;
>
> (d) has the greater number of rings;
>
> (e) has the greater number of skeletal atoms;
>
> (f) has the greater number of heteroatoms of any kind;
>
> (g) has the greater number of heteroatoms occurring earlier in the sequence: F > Cl > Br > I > O > S > Se > Te > N > P > As > Sb > Bi > Si > Ge > Sn > Pb > B > Al > Ga > In > Tl.

P-44.2.1.1 General methodology.

In order to apply [P-44.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4402) after [P-44.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4401) has failed to reach a conclusion, there must not be a characteristic group present in the compound, or the same number of a characteristic group must be present in all cyclic structures to be compared. In the following examples, as well as examples throughout [P-44.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4402), seniority is expressed by the symbol ‘>’ to be read as ‘senior to’. In the case of larger structures the phrase ‘is senior to’ is cited between the senior structure and the less senior structure.

Examples (the symbol > means ‘is senior to’):

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P440201a.gif)\
2-\[(naphthalen-2-yl)methyl]pyridine (PIN)\
(pyridine > naphthalene)Note: In this compound, there is no characteristic group to be cited as suffix. One ring must be chosen as the senior ring that will serve as the parent hydride; the other ring will be cited as a prefix to the parent hydride. Criteria in [P-44.2.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440201) must be applied starting from (a), in the order given, until a decision is reached. In this case, application of the first criterion (a) leads to a decision: the ring containing a nitrogen atom is selected as parent hydride; the naphthalene ring system is cited as a substituent.![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P440201b.gif)\
1,8-di(bicyclo\[3.2.1]octan-3-yl)anthracene (PIN)Note: In the above compound, there is no characteristic group to be cited as suffix. One ring must be chosen as the senior ring that will serve as the parent hydride; the other ring will be cited as a prefix to the parent hydride. Criteria in [P-44.2.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440201) must be applied starting from criterion (a), in the order given, until a decision is reached. In this case, application of criterion (d) leads to a decision: anthracene has more rings and is the parent structure; the bicyclo ring is cited as a substituent.![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P440201c.gif)\
4-\[(4-fluoro-2-methyl-1_H_-indol-5-yl)oxy]-6-methoxy-7-\[3-(pyrrolidin- 1-yl)propoxy]quinazoline (PIN)\
(quinazoline > indole > pyrrolidine)Note: In this compound, there are two ring systems and one ring. No characteristic group to be cited as suffix is present. Characteristic groups to be cited as prefixes are ignored at this stage of the selection of the senior ring or ring system. The ring system ‘quinazoline’ is selected as parent hydride after applying criteria (a), (b), and (d) in [P-44.2.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440201); and finally it is criterion (e) that permits a decision to be reached between ‘quinazoline’ and ‘indole’. Quinazoline is the parent hydride and both indole and pyrrolidine are included in the substituents cited as prefixes.![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P440201d.gif)\
4-(6-{2-\[(3-methylphenyl)methylidene]hydrazin-1-yl}-2-\[2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethoxy]pyrimidin-4-yl)morpholine (PIN)\
(morpholine > pyrimidine > pyridine > benzene)Note: In this compound, ‘morpholine’ is chosen as parent hydride, as a decision in the selection of the senior ring cannot be made until criterion (g [![error details](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/greek/ALTER.GIF)](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/changes.html)) in [P-44.2.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440201) is reached. The rings benzene, pyridine, and pyrimidine are expressed within the substituent prefixes.

P-44.2.1.2 The senior ring or ring system is a heterocycle \[criterion (a) in [P-44.2.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440201)]. Example (the symbol > means ‘is senior to’):

P-44.2.2 Seniority criteria for determining ring seniority applicable to particular types of ring systems.

P-44.2.2.1 Monocycles (see [P-22](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P2.html#22))

If [P-44.2.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440201) does not provide a decision, further criteria applicable to monocyclic rings are found in [P-44.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4404).

P-44.2.2.2 Polycyclic systems. The senior polycyclic ring system occurs first in the following list of polycyclic ring system types:

| The seniority order between parent hydrides having the same number of identical heteroatoms, the same number of rings, and the same number of skeletal atoms is a change from previous practice. Seniority of polycyclic ring systems is now facilitated by a hierarchical order of ring systems, which includes cyclic and acyclic phane systems and ranks all ring systems in the order given in this recommendation. |

P-44.2.2.2.6 Linear (acyclic) phanes

Although linear phane systems can be viewed as heteroacyclic chains, in which the amplificants are heteroatoms and the connecting atoms or chains are carbon atoms, seniority for linear (acyclic) phanes follows closely the criteria used for cyclic phane systems (see [P-44.2.2.2.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4402020202)). Accordingly, the seniority criteria for linear phane systems given below are applied successively until no alternatives remain. These criteria are illustrated in [P-44.2.2.2.6.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440202020601) through [P-44.2.2.2.6.10](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440202020610). The senior linear phane system has:

> (a) the senior amplificant, as defined by [P-44.2.1.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44020102) through [P-44.2.1.8](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44020108);
>
> (b) most amplificants in their order of seniority as defined by [P-44.2.1.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44020102) through [P-44.2.1.8](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44020108);
>
> (c) the maximum number of skeletal nodes;
>
> (d) the lower superatom locant(s) for the senior amplificant;
>
> (e) the lower superatom locant(s) for all amplificants as a set when compared term by term in order of increasing value and then in order of citation in the name;
>
> (f) the lower superatom locant(s) for all amplificants when compared in order of citation in the name;
>
> (g) the lower set of attachment locants considered as a set when compared term by term in order of increasing numerical value;
>
> (h) the lower set of attachment locants when compared term by term in their order of citation in the name;
>
> (i) the greater number of heteroatoms introduced by skeletal replacement (‘a’) nomenclature without regard to kind;
>
> (j) the greater number of heteroatoms introduced by skeletal replacement (‘a’) nomenclature first cited in the following order: F > Cl > Br > I > O > S > Se > Te > N > P > As > Sb > Bi > Si > Ge > Sn > Pb > B > Al > Ga > In > Tl.

P-44.3 SENIORITY OF ACYCLIC CHAINS (THE PRINCIPAL CHAIN)

In an acyclic compound consisting of individual atoms, alike or different (an acyclic chain), the chain on which the nomenclature and numbering is based is called the ‘principal chain’. When there is a choice for the principal chain, the following criteria are applied, in the order listed, until a decision is reached.

> The principal chain:
>
> (a) contains the greater number of heteroatoms of any kind;
>
> (b) has the greater number of skeletal atoms;
>
> (c) contains the greater number of the most senior acyclic heteroatom in the following sequence: O > S > Se > Te > N > P > As > Sb > Bi > Si > Ge > Sn > Pb > B > Al > Ga > In >Tl.

Each of these criteria is illustrated in [P-44.3.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440301) through [P-44.3.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440303) below.

| In acyclic parent structures the order of seniority between unsaturation and length of chain given in earlier recommendations is reversed. Thus, the first criterion to be considered in choosing a preferred parent acyclic chain is the length of the chain; unsaturation is now the second criterion. |

P-44.4.1.3 The senior ring, ring system, or principal chain has one or more atoms with nonstandard bonding numbers \[criterion (c) in [P-44.4.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440401)]. When choices are possible the following criteria are used in turn until a decision is reached.

P-44.4.1.3.1 When a choice is needed between two chains or between two rings or ring systems having skeletal atoms with nonstandard bonding numbers, the one having the maximum number of atoms with nonstandard bonding numbers is chosen as principal chain or senior ring or ring system. If a further choice is needed between the same skeletal atom with different nonstandard bonding numbers, preference for the senior parent structure is given in order of the decreasing numerical value of the bonding number, i.e., λ6 is senior to λ4.

P-44.4.1.3.2 When a choice is needed between two chains or rings or ring systems having skeletal atoms with nonstandard bonding numbers, the one having the lowest locant(s) for (an) atom(s) with nonstandard bonding number(s) is chosen as principal chain or senior ring or ring system. If a further choice is needed, the one with the higher bonding number with the lowest locant is chosen.

Example (the symbol > means ‘is senior to’):

P-44.4.1.10 The senior ring, ring system or principal chain has the lowest locants for endings or prefixes that express changes in the degree of hydrogenation, i.e., for ‘ene’ and ‘yne’ endings and ‘hydro/dehydro’ prefixes \[criterion (j) in [P-44.4.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440401)].

| The prefixes hydro or dehydro are introduced in names by an additive or subtractive operation; thus, they are not included in the category of alphabetizable detachable prefixes describing substitution ([P-15.1.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P1.html#150103)). In names, they occupy a place between nondetachable prefixes and the alphabetizable detachable prefixes. The prefixes hydro or dehydro express modifications of the degree of hydrogenation of a ring or ring system having the maximum number of noncumulative double bonds (a mancude structure) and are treated for numbering like the endings ‘ene’ and ‘yne’, which fulfill the same function. In names, the prefix ‘dehydro’ precedes the prefix ‘hydro’, when both are present. Simple numerical terms, such as ‘di-’,‘tetra-’, etc., are used with ‘hydro’ and ‘dehydro’. |

Criteria for choosing a preferred IUPAC name based on a senior parent structure as described in [P-44](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44) are found in [P-45](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#45).

P-44.4.1.11 The senior ring, ring system, or principal chain that has one or more isotopically modified atoms \[criterion (k) in [P-44.4.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440401)].

When there is a choice for the senior parent structure between isotopically modified and isotopically unmodified compounds or between isotopically modified compounds (see Chapter [P-8](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P8.html)), the senior parent structure is chosen according to the following criteria, applied successively until a decision can be made. In structures and names, nuclide symbols enclosed in parentheses describe isotopic substitution; nuclide symbols enclosed in square brackets describe isotopic labeling (see Chapter [P-8](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P8.html)).

P-44.4.1.11.1 The senior parent structure contains the greater number of isotopically modified atoms or groups.

P-44.4.1.12 The senior ring, ring system, or principal chain has one or more stereogenic centers \[criterion (l) in [P-44.4.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#440401)].

P-44.4.1.12.1 ‘_cis/trans_’ Isomerism, the ‘_E/Z_’ convention

When there is a choice between parent structures that differ only by ‘_Z_’ and ‘_E_’ configurations, the senior parent structure contains the greater number of double bonds with ‘_Z_’ configuration; when a further choice is required, the senior parent structure has the lowest locant set for the double bond(s) with the ‘_Z_’ configuration. For the meaning of ‘_Z_’ and ‘_E_’ see Chapter [P-9](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P9.html).

P-44.4.1.12.2 Enantiomerism, the ‘_R_’ and ‘_S_’ stereodescriptors

When there is a choice between parent structures differing only by the configurations of the chirality centers, the principal chain or the senior ring system is chosen by applying the CIP sequence rules 4 and 5, in the order: _like_ stereodescriptors such as ‘_RR_’, ‘_SS_’ have priority over _unlike_ ‘_RS_’ and ‘_SR_’ (‘_l_’ has priority over ‘_u_’), the ‘_r_’ over ‘_s_’, then ‘_R_’ over ‘_S_’. The CIP Sequence Rules are described in Chapter [P-9](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P9.html).

P-44.4.1.12.3 ‘_cis/trans_’ Isomerism (the ‘_E/Z_’ convention) and enantiomerism (the ‘_R/S_’ convention)

When there is a choice between parent structures that contain both ‘_E/Z_’ (or _cis/trans_) and ‘_R/S_’ descriptors the ‘_E/Z_’ (or _cis/trans_) descriptors are preferred to the ‘_R/S_’ descriptors.

P-45 SELECTION OF PREFERRED IUPAC NAMES

P-45.0 INTRODUCTION

Two or more names may result based on the same senior parent structure selected according to [P-44](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44), because of different substitution patterns or multiple occurrences of the same senior parent structure. A parent structure is defined ([P-15.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P1.html#1501)) as a parent hydride, for example, benzene, a functionalized parent hydride, for example cyclohexanol, or a functional parent compound, for example, acetic acid. Application of the criteria in this section will generate the preferred IUPAC name.

P-45.1 MULTIPLICATION OF IDENTICAL SENIOR PARENT STRUCTURES

P-45.1.1 Multiplicative nomenclature is senior to substitutive nomenclature for generating preferred IUPAC names to express multiple occurrences of identical senior parent structures, other than alkanes, in the name of the parent structure (see [P-51.3.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P5.html#510301)). In most cases multiplicative names are shorter than regular substitutive names. A preferred IUPAC name is generated by multiplicative nomenclature when the following criteria for its use are met (see [P-51.3.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P5.html#510301)).

> (1) the linking bonds (single or multiple) between the central substituent group of the multiplicative group and all subsequent structural units are identical; and
>
> (2) the multiplicative groups, other than the central multiplicative group, are symmetrically substituted; and
>
> (3) the locants of all substituent groups on the identical parent structures, including suffix groups, are identical.

When these conditions are not met, substitutive nomenclature generates preferred IUPAC names.

Example:

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450101a.gif)\
4,4′-oxybis(2-chlorobenzoic acid) (PIN, multiplicative name)\
but\
![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450101b.gif)\
4-(4-carboxy-2-chlorophenoxy)-2-chlorobenzoic acid (PIN, substitutive name)P-45.1.2 When two or more parent structures, rings, ring systems, or chains, satisfy the requirements for multiplicative nomenclature (see [P-15.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P1.html#1503)), the structure chosen as the parent structure to be multiplied is the more numerous.

Examples:

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450102a.gif)\
1,1′-\[(phenylmethylene)bis(sulfanediylmethylene)]dibenzene (PIN)\
(multiplication of three benzene rings is not possible)

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450102b.gif)\

_N_,_N_′-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis\[_N_-(carboxymethyl)glycine]

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450102c.gif)\
4,4′,4′′-(ethene-1,1,2-triyl)trianiline (PIN)\
\[not 4,4′-\[2-(4-aminophenyl)ethene-1,1-diyl]dianiline;\
the PIN multiplies three parent structures;\
the second name multiplies only two]

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450102d.gif)\
\[phosphanetriyltris(methylene)]tris(phosphonic acid) (PIN)

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450102e.gif)\
1,1′,1′′-({\[(diphenylmethyl)sulfanyl]diphenylmethoxy}methanetriyl)tribenzene (PIN)\
(not 1,1′-({\[diphenyl(triphenylmethoxy)methyl]sulfanyl}methylene)dibenzene;\
the PIN multiplies three parent structures;\
the second name multiplies only two)

P-45.2 CRITERIA RELATED TO NUMBER AND LOCATION OF SUBSTITUENT GROUPS

The following criteria are applied, in turn, until a decision is reached. The preferred IUPAC name is the name based on the senior parent structure that has:

> [P-45.2.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#450201) the maximum number of substituent groups cited as prefixes;\
> [P-45.2.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#450202) the lower locant set for substituent groups cited as prefixes;\
> [P-45.2.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#450203) the lower locant set for substituent groups in order of citation in the name

P-45.2.1 The preferred IUPAC name is based on the senior parent structure that has the maximum number of substituents cited as prefixes (other than ‘hydro/dehydro’) to the parent structure.

P-45.3 CRITERIA RELATED ONLY TO SUBSTITUENTS WITH NONSTANDARD BONDING NUMBERS, OTHER CRITERIA BEING EQUAL

The following criteria are relative only to substituents with nonstandard bonding numbers applied in turn, until a decision is reached, earlier criteria having been satisfied.

> [P-45.3.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#450301) the maximum number of substituent group(s) with the higher bonding number cited as prefixes;\
> [P-45.3.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#450302) the lower locant set for substituent group(s) with the higher bonding number cited as prefixes.

P-45.3.1 The preferred IUPAC name is based on the senior parent structure that has the maximum number of substituent group(s) with the higher bonding number cited as prefixes and directly connected to the parent structure.

Examples:

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450301a.gif)\
3-(λ5-phosphanyl)-2-(phosphanylmethyl)propanoic acid (PIN)\
\[not 3-phosphanyl-2-(λ5-phosphanylmethyl)propanoic acid;\
the PIN parent structure contains the substituent group having the highest bonding number, ‘λ5’ > ‘λ3’]

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450301b.gif)\
4-(2λ5-diphosphan-1-yl)-2-(2-diphosphanylethyl)butanenitrile (PIN)\
\[not 4-diphosphanyl-2-\[2-(2λ5-diphosphan-1-yl)ethyl]butanenitrile;\
the PIN parent structure contains the substituent group having the highest bonding number, ‘λ5’ > ‘λ3’]

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450301c.gif)\
3-(λ6-sulfanyl)-2-(λ4-sulfanylmethyl)propanoic acid (PIN)\
\[not 3-(λ4-sulfanyl)-2-(λ6-sulfanylmethyl)propanoic acid;\
the PIN parent structure contains the substituent group having the highest bonding number, ‘λ6’ > ‘λ4’]

P-45.3.2 The preferred IUPAC name has the lower locant set for substituent group(s) with the higher bonding number(s) cited as prefixes.

Example:

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450302a.gif)\
5-(1λ5-diphospan-1-yl)-2-\[3-(2λ5-diphospan-1-yl)propyl]pentanoic acid (PIN)\
\[not 5-(2λ5-diphospan-1-yl)-2-\[3-(1λ5-diphospan-1-yl)propyl]pentanoic acid]\
The locant ‘1λ5’ for the nonstandard bonding number directly bonded to the parent structure is lower than ‘2λ5’.P-45.4 CRITERIA RELATED ONLY TO ISOTOPIC MODIFICATION OF SUBSTITUENTS

The following criteria are relative only to substituents with isotopic modification applied in turn, until a decision is reached, earlier criteria having been satisfied.

P-45.4.1 The preferred IUPAC name is based on the senior parent structure that has the lowest locant(s) for isotopically modified substituent groups.

Example:

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450401a.gif)\
2-bromo-1-{\[2-(81Br)bromopentyl]oxy}pentane (PIN)\
\[not 2-(81Br)bromo-1-\[(2-bromopentyl)oxy]pentane]\
The isotopically modified substituent for the PIN is attached at ‘1’ which is lower than ‘2’.P-45.4.2 The preferred IUPAC name is based on the senior parent structure that has the lowest locant(s) for nuclides of higher atomic number.

Example:

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450402a.gif)\
2-(13C)methoxy-_N_-\[2-(18O)methoxyethyl]ethan-1-amine (PIN)\
\[not 2-(18O)methoxy-_N_-\[2-(13C)methoxyethyl]ethan-1-amine]\
18O > 13C; the 18O isotopically modified substituent for the PIN is attached at ‘_N_’ which is lower than ‘2’. [![names corrected](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/greek/ALTER.GIF)](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/changes.html)P-45.4.3 The preferred IUPAC name is based on the senior parent structure that has the lowest locant(s) for nuclides of higher mass number.

Example:

![](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4gif/P450403a.gif)\
4-\[2-13C]ethyl-2-(2-\[2-14C]ethylpentyl)heptan-1-ol (PIN)\
\[not 4-\[2-14C]ethyl-2-(2-\[2-13C]ethylpentyl)heptan-1-ol\
14C > 13C; the 14C isotopically modified substituent for the PIN is attached at ‘2’ which is lower than ‘4’ [![names corrected](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/greek/ALTER.GIF)](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/changes.html)P-45.5 CRITERIA RELATED TO ALPHANUMERICAL ORDER OF NAMES

The preferred IUPAC name is the name that is earlier in alphanumerical order (see [P-14.5](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P1.html#1405)). Alphabetic letters are considered first in the order that they appear in the name; all Roman letters are considered before any italic letters, unless the latter are used as locants or are a part of a compound or composite locant, for example, ‘_N_’ and ‘4a’. Then, if still there is a choice, numerical locants are considered in the order of their appearance in the name.

P-45.6 CRITERIA RELATED ONLY TO CONFIGURATION

P-45.6.1 Introduction

This section is concerned only with the main principles for specification of configuration in names of organic compounds. The spatial structure of an organic compound is systematically indicated by one or more affixes added to a name that does not itself prescribe configuration; such affixes are generally called ‘stereodescriptors’ and do not change the preferred IUPAC name of a compound established by the principles of nomenclature described in other sections of these recommendations (see [P-44](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44) and [P-45](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#45)), under the condition that no choice has yet been encountered during the construction of the preferred IUPAC name. When there is a choice, the preferred IUPAC name must be constructed in conformity with the rules for choosing the principal chain or the senior ring or ring system and also with the priority of the stereodescriptors. Thus, stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and _cis_/_trans_ isomers, have names, substitutive or multiplicative, that differ only in the stereodescriptors used. Stereodescriptors describing preferred IUPAC names are all Cahn-Ingold-Prelog CIP descriptors, such as _E_, _Z_, _R_, _S_, _r_ and _s_ discussed and illustrated in Chapter [P-9](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P9.html).

P-45.6.2 General principles. The choice of a parent structure based on the number and location of multiple bonds and double bonds (see [P-44.4.1.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44040101), [P-44.4.1.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44040102), and [P-44.4.1.12](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#44040112)) is not configuration dependent. As an example, the configuration of the double bond may be _Z_ or _E_ in the following alkene that is named according to [P-31.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P3.html#3101). The names with and without stereodescriptors are the same, i.e. butene. Preferred IUPAC names are generated from the preferred IUPAC name of the alkene when stereodescriptors are correct.

In contrast, multiplicative names (see [P-45.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4501) and [P-15.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P1.html#1503)) are configuration dependent as shown below. Two different procedures are required: a multiplicative name to describe identical configurations (‘_E_’ or ‘_Z_’; or ‘_R_’ or ‘_S_’) in identical units and a substitutive name to describe different configurations (‘_E_’ and ‘_Z_’ or ‘_R_’ and ‘_S_’) as shown by the first example below.

(substitutive names; for the priority of ‘_Z_’ > ‘_E_’ > ‘_R_’ > ‘_S_’, see [P-92](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P9.html#92))

\[not 1-\[(2_S_)-butan-2-yl]-4-({4-\[(2_R_)-butan-2-yl]phenyl}sulfanyl)benzene;\
also a substitutive name but since the alphabetic characters and locants\
(ignoring the configuration symbols)\
are identical the configurational symbols are compared and ‘_R_’ precedes ‘_S_’]

1,2-bis\[(1_S_)-1-chloroethyl]-4-{3-\[(1_R_)-1-chloroethyl]-4-\[(1_S_)-1-chloroethyl]phenoxy}benzene (PIN)\
(a substitutive name; a multiplicative name is not allowed)\
\[not 4-{3,4-bis\[(1_S_)-1-chloroethyl]phenoxy}-2-\[(1_R_)-1-chloroethyl]-1-\[(1_S_)-1-chloroethyl]benzene;\
‘1,2,4’ is senior to ‘4,2,1’ (see [P-45.2.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#450203))]

P-45.6.3 When names based on alphanumerical order and isotopic descriptors are the same, further choice depends on the alphabetic order of the stereochemical descriptors ‘_R_’ and ‘_S_’.

1-\[(1_R_)-1-bromoethyl]-1-\[(1_S_)-1-bromoethyl]cyclopentane (PIN)\

‘_R_’ precedes ‘_S_’]P-46 THE PRINCIPAL CHAIN IN SUBSTITUENT GROUPS

P-46.0 INTRODUCTION

Compound acyclic substituents, i.e., substituted acyclic substituents, consist of a principal chain and one or more acyclic substituents. If the substituent to the principal chain also has (an) acyclic substituent(s), it itself is a compound substituent; the resulting complete substituent is called a complex acyclic substituent. Complex substituents are named by extending the methods given below for compound substituents.

Compound substituents are named in two ways:

> (1) by using alkyl substituents \[see [P-29.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P2.html#2902)(1)];
>
> (2) by using alkanyl substituents \[see [P-29.2](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P2.html#2902)(2)].

Alkyl and alkanyl substituent groups have been defined in Section [P-29](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P2.html#29). Simple alkyl substituent groups have their free valence(s) denoted by the suffixes ‘yl’, ‘ylidene’ or ‘ylidyne’ only at position 1. Simple alkanyl substituent groups have their free valence(s) denoted by the suffixes ‘yl’ or ‘ylidene’ which may be located at any position of the chain except position 1. Both alkyl and alkanyl substituent groups can form compound substituent groups; for example, CH3-C(CH3)2– is 1,1-dimethylethyl, a compound alkyl substituent group, by method (1); and 2-methylpropan-2-yl, a compound alkanyl substituent group, by method (2). In some cases, a compound substituent group resulting from substitution of the principal chain by alkyl or alkanyl substituent groups results in the same structure that corresponds to a simple alkanyl substituent group; for example, CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)– is 1-methylpentyl by method (1), but hexan-2- yl by method (2).

P-46.1 THE PRINCIPAL SUBSTITUENT CHAIN

Selection of the principal chain of a compound substituent is accomplished in accordance with the following criteria, applied successively in the order given until a decision is reached. They are listed here and illustrated in [P-46.1.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#460101) through [P-46.1.13](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#460113). The principal substituent chain has:

> (a) the greater number of heteroatoms; this criterion is used only in method (2) in [P-46.0](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4600);
>
> (b) the greater number of skeletal atoms, i.e., the longest chain;
>
> (c) the greater number of heteroatoms in the order: O > S > Se > Te > N > P > As > Sb > Bi > Si > Ge > Sn > Pb > B > Al > Ga > In > Tl;
>
> (d) the greater number of multiple bonds regardless of type, then the greater number of double bonds;
>
> (e) one or more atoms with nonstandard bonding numbers;
>
> (f) the lowest locants for heteroatoms; this criterion is used only in method (2) in P-46.0;
>
> (g) the lowest locants for heteroatoms appearing first in the order: O > S > Se > Te > N > P > As > Sb > Bi > Si > Ge > Sn > Pb > B > Al > Ga > In > Tl;
>
> (h) the lowest locants for free valences of any kind (‘yl’, ‘ylidene’, ‘ylidyne’);
>
> (i) the lowest locant(s) for multiple bonds, regardless of type, then the lower locant(s) for double bonds;
>
> (j) the lowest locant(s) for (an) atom(s) with nonstandard bonding number(s);
>
> (k) the greatest number of substituents of any kind; this criterion is applicable to both methods (1) and (2) in [P-46.0](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4600);
>
> (l) the lowest locants for substituents; this criterion is applicable to both methods (1) and (2) in [P-46.0](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4600);
>
> (m) the lowest locants for the substituent(s) cited earlier in alphanumerical order; this criterion is applicable to both methods (1) and (2) in [P-46.0](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4600).

P-46.1.1 The principal substituent chain has the greater number of heteroatoms \[criterion (a) in [P-46.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4601)]; this criterion is used only in method (2) of [P-46.0](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4600).

7-propyl-2,4,6,8-tetrasilanonan-1-yl (preferred prefix)\
\[not 7-(methylsilyl)-2,4,6-trisiladecan-1-yl]P-46.1.2 The principal substituent chain has the greater number of skeletal atoms, i.e., the longest chain \[criterion (b) in [P-46.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4601)]. This criterion is applicable to both methods (1) and (2) of [P-46.0](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4600); both methods generate simple and compound substituent groups.

P-46.1.5 The principal substituent chain has one or more atoms with nonstandard bonding numbers \[criterion (e) in [P-46.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4601)]. When a choice is needed between two substituent chains having skeletal atoms with nonstandard bonding numbers, the one having the maximum number of atoms with nonstandard bonding numbers is chosen as principal substituent chain. If a further choice is needed between the same skeletal atom with different nonstandard bonding numbers, preference for the principal substituent chain is given in order of the decreasing numerical value of the bonding number, i.e., λ6 is senior to λ4.

P-46.1.6 The principal substituent chain has the lowest locants for heteroatoms \[criterion (f) in [P-46.1](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4601)]; this criterion is used only in method (2) of [P-46.0](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P4.html#4600).

| This is a change. Heteroatoms in chains are now considered as part of the parent hydride; as such they have seniority over suffixes for numbering (see [P-14.4](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P1.html#1404); see also [P-15.4.3](https://iupac.qmul.ac.uk/BlueBook/P1.html#150403)); this change makes ‘a’ terms nondetachable in skeletal replacement in chains, rings, and ring systems. |
